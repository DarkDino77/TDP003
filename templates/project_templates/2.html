    <li><strong>Grading Criteria:</strong> The course has specific grading criteria based on lab performance and final project.</li>
    <li><strong>Guidance:</strong> Each lab comes with an instructor-led explanation and example codes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<p>The course strictly focuses on Python, with minimal use of additional libraries. It allows the use of lambdas but avoids other higher-order functions.</p>
