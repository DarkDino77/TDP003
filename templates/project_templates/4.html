<h1>Project in Object-Oriented Design, by Making a Game</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This project focused on teaching object-oriented design through the process of game creation. The game was made in C++ using the SFML library to abstract the complicated process of making graphics and characters move.</p>

<h2>The Game</h2>
<p>The game that was created is a top-down endless survivor shooter, where the player fights against an ever-increasing amount of enemies that come in waves. The point of the game is to survive as long as possible. As the player kills the enemies, the player is rewarded with increasingly powerful weapons and upgrades.</p>

<h2>Learned Experiences</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Object-Oriented Design:</strong> A large part of this project was considering a proper object-oriented design of the system. It was noticed during the game's creation that a larger part of the code than previously thought could be broken down into smaller classes, while some parts could be removed altogether.</li>
    <li><strong>UML:</strong> A UML diagram of the game was drawn before and revised as a better structure became apparent. The drawing of the UML diagram and its relevant components was a new and interesting experience.</li>
    <li><strong>Profiling:</strong> The usage of a profiler was used while making the game, which helped expose some flaws that the game contained, harming the game's overall performance capabilities.</li>
    <li><strong>Smart Pointers:</strong> When making the game, shared_ptr was used instead of raw pointers to simplify memory management. However, it was during the creation of this game that we learned that, to properly use them, they have their own way of making new pointers that needs to be applied.</li>
    <li><strong>Proper Return and Input Values:</strong> One of the challenges incurred during the process of making the game was the performance impact of not returning or taking in complex data types as references where appropriate.</li>
    <li><strong>Doxygen:</strong> During the project, we used Doxystrings to write comments on the code that later was used to automate the writing of the documentation of the program. This has been an interesting experience and felt really good at the end and beats the process of writing the document manually. So, this has been a good introduction to the usage and capabilities of Doxygen, and I look forward to using it extensively moving forward.</li>
