<h1>Project in Object-Oriented Design, by Making a Game</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This project focused on teaching object-oriented design through the process of game creation. The game was made in C++ using the SFML library to abstract the complicated process of making graphics and characters move.</p>

<br>
<h2>The Game</h2>
"The Grand Arena" is a top-down arena shooter. The aim of the game is to survive as many waves of enemies as posible by slaying your way through waves with increasing dificulty. Each slayed enemy contributes to your characters strength. At the beginning you're given a rather simple weapon, able to hold of the weakest of enemies, but it's not long until you've unlocked your next weapon, and before you know it you'll have the firepower to hold back waves of them. But for how long?
<br>
<br>You never know what enemies you are facing in the next wave so be prepared to change your strategies for survival.
<br>    
<br> The game aims towards those who like to get them selves out of difficult situations under a high pace. With a limited amount of gamerules no prior knowledge is required, but it will require a deep mastery of them to be the last man standing. But in essence, the game aims towards those who like to tackle endless waves of enemies and try to survive the impossible odds.


<h2>Learned Experiences</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Object-Oriented Design:</strong> A large part of this project was considering a proper object-oriented design of the system. It was noticed during the game's creation that a larger part of the code than previously thought could be broken down into smaller classes, while some parts could be removed altogether.</li>
    <li><strong>UML:</strong> A UML diagram of the game was drawn before and revised as a better structure became apparent. The drawing of the UML diagram and its relevant components was a new and interesting experience.</li>
    <li><strong>Profiling:</strong> The usage of a profiler was used while making the game, which helped expose some flaws that the game contained, harming the game's overall performance capabilities.</li>
    <li><strong>Smart Pointers:</strong> When making the game, shared_ptr was used instead of raw pointers to simplify memory management. However, it was during the creation of this game that we learned that, to properly use them, they have their own way of making new pointers that needs to be applied.</li>
    <li><strong>Proper Return and Input Values:</strong> One of the challenges incurred during the process of making the game was the performance impact of not returning or taking in complex data types as references where appropriate.</li>
    <li><strong>Doxygen:</strong> During the project, we used Doxystrings to write comments on the code that later was used to automate the writing of the documentation of the program. This has been an interesting experience and felt really good at the end and beats the process of writing the document manually. So, this has been a good introduction to the usage and capabilities of Doxygen, and I look forward to using it extensively moving forward.</li>
